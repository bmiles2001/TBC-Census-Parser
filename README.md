# TBC-Census-Parser
Census Parser for TBC. This parses the TBC LUA database file and outputs some metrics into a text file.

# Problem
People typically post screenshots of the Census data but it can be hard to read and isn't necessary useful.

# What it does
It reads the entire LUA file (from Saved Variables) and outputs it into a text file that can be utilized with this application.

# How do I use it 
On only first run: Configure the app settings by editing the app.settings.json file and specifying your server and faction.
Afterwards, you copy the CensusPlus.lua file into where the .exe file is and just run the app.
